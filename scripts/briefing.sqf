Your mission will require you to infiltrate the <marker name='areaMarker'>area of a small hotel</marker> northeast of Luganville.<br/>
This hotel was recently occupied by a Syndikat group, who took two IDAP aid workers hostage.<br/>
As both workers are citizens of NATO countries, it is your teams responsibility to free them from the Syndikat, and to exfiltrate them from the area.<br/>

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Situation", "
Your team has been deployed to a mission in Tanoa, where an independent militia called Syndikat is controlling huge areas of the region.<br/>
It is well know to murder or torture civilians that don't actively support them.<br/>
Currently, there is no official military operation running against the Syndikat, so your deployment officially never happened.<br/>
This means there is no support expectable for the full duration of the operation.<br/>
